[Demo](https://ramadityo.github.io/)

this website have little bit lacks, such as:

**1. Unsupported small devices** 
   - (320 x 568) px
   - more smaller

**2. Unrecommended for low-end specs**

   Because my website have a lot of animation (Maybe), so it will can be laggish for low-end PC

**3. Slow image rendering for 3G - Lower Internet (depending on your area)**
   
   Sometimes, when my client is visiting my website it's very slow to rendering my image and the other clients it's very fast to render it in 3G Network
